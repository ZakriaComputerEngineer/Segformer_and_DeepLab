# Segformer and Deeplabv3 application on Xray threat detection on bags
2 models trained in 2 epoches each, both are heavy architectures and require good system performance for training. reached accuracy 64% but trained under 50% dataset as training was taking time, you can train it in 100% dataset from the link given below. increase the epoches if you have good system otherwise 2 epoches are good enough to test the model predictions.
